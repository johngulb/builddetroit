Lipman’s ephemeral and intricate vignettes employ the narrative power of objects to address mortality, materiality, and temporality. Letinsky’s work also speaks to these fleeting moments using the conditions of photography, and the notion that a photograph is a promise that can never be delivered. From excess to absence, these works invite us into the heart of the home. <br><br>\n<strong>Event Details</strong><br>\nSaturday, September 23<br>\n5:00 pm - 8:00 pm<br><br>\n\n<strong>About Wasserman Projects</strong><br>\nWasserman Projects is a flexible and constantly evolving program of art, design, and music, that brings together artists of all disciplines.

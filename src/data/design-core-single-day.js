    desc: 'The Latin root animare means ""give breath to"" and ""endow with spirit."" The objects in this collection were made from plastic waste found in alleys, dumpsters, and on the street. re:animation documents the journey from trash to treasure. Material that was at one time a living dinosaur, was then processed into plastic, before being discarded as waste. This body of work extends the lifespan of this material by creating organic forms resembling living organisms, with a nod to the items’ original function. <br><br>\nJoin Cody Norman and Gallery Director Isabelle Weiss in discussion of the creation of this new body of work as well as Norman\'s mission to challenge our perception of material and confront the reality of plastic waste in our environment. With only nine percent of plastic being recycled annually, the remainder is either burned, dumped in landfills, or left in the environment to disintegrate into microplastics, working its way up the food chain to humans. Throughout his career, Norman has created numerous bodies of work that not only challenge the role of the viewer in consuming/discarding plastic but also our perception of plastic as an inferior ""fine art"" material due to its synthetic nature.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Event Details</strong><br>\nSaturday, September 2nd<br>\n4:00 pm - 6:00 pm<br><br>\n\n<strong>About I.M.

Weiss Gallery was founded in 2014, originally as NEXT:SPACE, by Isabelle Weiss, an Accredited Appraiser and Contemporary Fine/Decorative Arts specialist in Detroit, MI. Their mission is to nurture a new generation of the region’s iconic craft and design legacy. They approach their first decade of supporting contemporary craft and design in Detroit with renewed focus on scholarship and personal stewardship—important tools in building the value and legacy of craft and design in the contemporary art market—for Detroit and beyond.\n<br><br>\n<strong>About Cody Norman</strong><br>\nCody Norman is a Chicago-based artist, designer, and educator. Norman works with both digital and analog fabrication processes to transform recycled and bio plastics into functional art objects.

Lipman’s ephemeral and intricate vignettes employ the narrative power of objects to address mortality, materiality, and temporality. Letinsky’s work also speaks to these fleeting moments using the conditions of photography, and the notion that a photograph is a promise that can never be delivered. From excess to absence, these works invite us into the heart of the home. <br><br>\n<strong>Event Details</strong><br>\nSaturday, September 23<br>\n5:00 pm - 8:00 pm<br><br>\n\n<strong>About Wasserman Projects</strong><br>\nWasserman Projects is a flexible and constantly evolving program of art, design, and music, that brings together artists of all disciplines.
